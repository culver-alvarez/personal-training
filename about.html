            <h3>
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bennyalvarez/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Benny Alvarez</em></strong></a>
                and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-p-culver/" target="_blank"><strong><em>David Culver</em></strong></a> are both graduates of
                <strong><em>Codeup</em></strong>, a fully-immersive, project-based, and intensive<br> 22-week Full-Stack Java Career Accelerator that provides
                students with 670 hours of expert instruction in software<br> development. They have become good friends since, living a healthier lifestyle,
                though still having the occasional late<br> night talk about their love for cheeseburgers, and continue making projects together through paired programming.<br><br>
                Mr. Cosme is a personal friend of Benny, who has helped guide him towards better health when he heard of Benny's<br>
                successful attempts at weight loss with mostly diet alone and wanted to support him more through personal training.<br>
                Mr. Cosme helped train Benny through zoom calls since they live in different states and for no charge. Moved by his<br>
                love and generosity, Benny has built this website as a token of his gratitude for his good friend, Harris Cosme<br> in
                supporting his small business.</br>
